Project Description

IoT based visitor counter project using beaglebone black is designed keeping current Covid-19 scenario in mind as nowadays there are restrictions on gatherings. This IoT based visitor counter system can be used to keep a track of number of people in a store, for example a grocery store, at a particular time. 

In this project, sensors are used to detect the presence of a person and counters are designed to count the people entering and leaving a store. The number will be displayed on the screen and this number will also be updated on web page for remote use. A customer can check number of people present in store via web page before coming to store and while standing in line they can see a count on the LCD display.

In addition to this, two DC motors are used to control the access at entry and exit. Once the maximum count is reached, the gate will be closed, and it will reopen again when one customer will leave the store and the count decreases.

Moreover, temperature sensor is also used in this project. It is used to make sure no customer can enter the store who has temperature more than the threshold value. If the sensor senses the higher temperature, then the buzzer is going to ring, and the gate will be closed. The number of people detected with high temperature will also be updated on the web page for remote use.
